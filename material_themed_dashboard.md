# Material-Themed Dashboard Demo

This markdown document accompanies the `material_themed_dashboard.py` script and explains how to run the Panel dashboard and what to expect when you open it.

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to build a polished, interactive dashboard in Python using the [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) library from the HoloViz ecosystem.  The script generates a simple scatter plot with a Material design theme.  By specifying `design='material'` when enabling the Panel extension, the entire dashboard adopts a professional, modern look without any custom CSS or JavaScript.

Key features of the dashboard include:

- A scatter plot generated with random data using HoloViz's `hvPlot` API.
- Controls for adjusting the number of data points and random seed to explore different datasets.
- The ability to switch to other themes (e.g. Bootstrap, Fast) by changing the `design` parameter in the script.

## How to Run the Dashboard

To run the dashboard locally, ensure you have Panel and its dependencies installed.  You can install the necessary packages via pip:

```bash
pip install panel hvplot
```

Once installed, start the dashboard using the `panel serve` command:

```bash
panel serve material_themed_dashboard.py --autoreload
```

This command starts a local web server (usually at `http://localhost:5006/material_themed_dashboard`) where you can interact with the scatter plot and see the Material theme applied.  The `--autoreload` flag tells Panel to automatically reload the dashboard when you modify the script.

## What You'll See

When you open the served page in your browser, you will see a scatter plot of random data points styled with the Material design.  The top of the dashboard contains sliders for the number of points and the random seed.  Adjusting these controls updates the plot in real time, illustrating how Panel enables reactive data exploration.

If you want to try a different look and feel, edit `material_themed_dashboard.py` and change the line:

```python
pn.extension(design="material")
```

to one of the other supported design values like `'bootstrap'`, `'fast'`, or `'native'`.
